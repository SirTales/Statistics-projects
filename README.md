This is a repository for all my work with statistical analysis on datasets (from simple to complex models).

In project 2, I perform a box plot and show the cumulative distribution for the Iris dataset

In project 3, the Student's T test is done in US's 60 crime rate data, to present the factors that have influence in the data
